# Anomaly
This challenge requires players to use SHA-512 way too many times.

## Question Text
I have made this file by using SHA-512 512 times on every number in string format from 1 to 1000000. However there are some anomalies in the file when I re-ran the same program. Can you find out the anomaly for me?
